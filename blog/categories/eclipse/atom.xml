    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In continuation to my other post on <a href="http://p7h.blogspot.com/2012/12/intellij-idea-tuning-parameters.html" target="_blank">tuning IntelliJ IDEA</a>, in this post I am detailing the startup options [which are also called JVM Settings] for Eclipse IDE. Eclipse startup is controlled by the options in <code>eclipse.ini</code> file present directly under Eclipse installation folder [i.e. $ECLIPSE_HOME]. By default, Eclipse comes with a set of values in this file. But those values are not optimized and might cause issues and / or hangs in large projects which might have considerably bigger codebase. These can be tuned further for better performance.<br /></p>

<p>My startup options in my current version of Eclipse Juno i.e. v4.2.1 are listed below.

<p><div><script src='https://gist.github.com/4392224.js'></script>
<noscript><pre><code>-startup
plugins/org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_1.3.0.v20120522-1813.jar
--launcher.library

-Xverify:none
-XX:+UseFastAccessorMethods
-Dosgi.requiredJavaVersion=1.5
-Dhelp.lucene.tokenizer=standard</code></pre></noscript></div>
</p>

<p>Please use these options as a reference and update <code>eclipse.ini</code> file [please do take a backup of this file prior to updating it]. Also, one more important point to note is, use the latest <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html" target="_blank">Sun / Oracle JDK</a> for starting Eclipse. This also has a profound effect on the Eclipse startup time as well as the IDE functionality with a decent sized codebase.<br /></p>

<p>Finally, in case you were looking for tuning the startup options of IntelliJ IDEA, please refer my earlier post on tuning <a href="http://p7h.org/2012/12/intellij-idea-tuning-parameters.html" target="_blank">startup parameters for IDEA</a>.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://eclipse.org/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a> was my main IDE for all my JavaEE and Web development all the time in my career. For all plain Java development and Android app development, I used to revert to <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank">IntelliJ IDEA</a> Community Edition, which allows only plain Java development and not Enterprise Java development i.e. JavaEE or Web Development [Spring, Hibernate, Grails, etc]. For more info on what is allowed and what is not allowed in Community Edition, please check <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html" target="_blank">matrix on CE and Ultimate Editions</a>.<br />
Post the <a href="http://p7h.blogspot.com/2012/12/jetbrains-mayan-doomsday-special-offers.html" target="_blank">Mayan Doomsday Offer</a> by JetBrains, thanks to the 75% steep discount on 20th December, 2012 I now have IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition as well <em>and have been renewing every year after that</em>.<br />

<p>Eclipse is open source and is free to use. It is a thriving community for individuals and organizations which collaborate on commercially-friendly open source software. So, over a period of time Eclipse grew on all developers and almost everyone uses it as their main driver for development. And what’s more with Scala, Groovy and Android teams giving support for Eclipse as the first IDE has given it a good momentum in the past few years.<br /></p>

<p>The plugin ecosystem is huge in Eclipse and in fact, these plugins have helped Eclipse grow as a platform what it is today. Such is the popularity of plugins in Eclipse ecosystem that they have also launched <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/" target="_blank">Marketplace</a> for Eclipse plugins. If something is missing in Eclipse, don’t worry, just check the Marketplace for the plugin or else you can develop a plugin in no time actually. That has been the mindset of a lot of Java developers in Eclipse ecosystem. There are thousands of plugins available for Eclipse right from customizing the IDE to Maven integration to Python IDE to Spring IDE, for Checkstyle, PMD, FindBugs, etc. <br /></p>

<p>With all my prior experience in using Eclipse, I have some goto plugins which I install the moment I get a brand new Eclipse version. Here is the list of all Eclipse plugins which I have used till now with a short description and the Eclipse Update Sites of the plugin.
