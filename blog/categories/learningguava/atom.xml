    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Many of our day-to-day applications would need calibrating time taken between 2 points. In Java world we either depend on <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#currentTimeMillis()" target="_blank"><code>System.currentTimeMillis()</code></a> or <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#nanoTime()" target="_blank"><code>System.nanoTime()</code></a>. But the pain here is, we have to do the required computations of getting to a proper granularity to understand the time taken. Would n’t it be great it to have such an utility class which will give the required information in the granularity we need with minimum amount of boilerplate code?<br /><br /><a href="http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/base/Stopwatch.html" target="_blank"><code>Stopwatch</code></a> is one such small and wonderful utility class in Guava which helps in calibrating elapsed time / duration between any 2 points in the logic. The advantage of using Guava’s <code>Stopwatch</code> is you can get the elapsed time in any measure i.e. right from nanoseconds to days. This is possible because you can pass an enum argument type of <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/TimeUnit.html" target="_blank"><code>TimeUnit</code></a> class to get the elapsed time in the desired granularity.

Code snippet for the usage of the <code>Stopwatch</code> class:

<noscript><pre><code>import java.util.Random;
import java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;

import com.google.common.base.Stopwatch;

/**
 * Sample example demonstrating usage of Stopwatch API of Google Guava.
 *
 * @see &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/base/Stopwatch.html&quot;&gt;Guava Stopwatch&lt;/a&gt;
 */
public final class StopwatchExample {

	public final static void main(final String[] args) {
		//Effective Guava v15.0, this is the one way of creating a Stopwatch instance.
		final Stopwatch stopwatch = Stopwatch.createStarted();

		//Sleep for few random milliseconds.
		try {
			Thread.sleep(new Random().nextInt(1000));
		} catch (final InterruptedException interruptedException) {
			interruptedException.printStackTrace();
		}

		stopwatch.stop(); //optional

		System.out.println(&quot;Elapsed time ==&gt; &quot; + stopwatch);
		System.out.println(&quot;Elapsed time in Nanoseconds ==&gt; &quot; + stopwatch.elapsed(TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS));
		System.out.println(&quot;Elapsed time in Microseconds ==&gt; &quot; + stopwatch.elapsed(TimeUnit.MICROSECONDS));
		System.out.println(&quot;Elapsed time in Milliseconds ==&gt; &quot; + stopwatch.elapsed(TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS));
		//System.out.println(&quot;Elapsed time in Seconds ==&gt; &quot; + stopwatch.elapsed(TimeUnit.SECONDS));
		//System.out.println(&quot;Elapsed time in Minutes ==&gt; &quot; + stopwatch.elapsed(TimeUnit.MINUTES));
	}

<p>Few caveats for using <code>Stopwatch</code> are you should not start an already started <code>Stopwatch</code>. One has to check if the <code>Stopwatch</code> is already running by invoking <a href="http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/base/Stopwatch.html#isRunning()" target="_blank"><code>isRunning()</code></a> method. <code>Stopwatch</code> documentation says the following on the same:<br />
&lt;blockquote class=&#8221;tr_bq&#8221; style=&#8221;background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; color: #303030; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px; margin-bottom: 15px;&#8221;&gt;Stopwatch methods are not idempotent; it is an error to start or stop a stopwatch that is already in the desired state.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Also, once I got burned down by <a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/javadocs/api-3.2.1/org/apache/commons/lang3/time/StopWatch.html" target="_blank"><code>StopWatch</code></a> class of Apache Commons Lang. As I was working in an IDE on a Maven project, I could not quickly relate to the difference between <code>Stopwatch</code> of Guava and <code>StopWatch</code> of Apache Commons Lang, as the class got auto imported into the code and then spent some good 20 minutes trying to check my classpath, IDE setup, etc. Yes very silly mistake. So, please be careful in choosing the correct class.</p>

    <updated>2013-11-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://p7h.org/blog/2013/11/27/google-guava-posts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>​I have been a huge fan of <a href="https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/" style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px;" target="_blank">Google Guava</a> from the time I came across it 3 years back.<br />For starters, Guava is a project which contains many Google’s core libraries like collections, caching, math, primitives, concurrency, networking, common annotations, string processing, I/O, reflection and many others. It is very well designed API. Guava is designed, implemented and maintained by Google Engineers like <a href="https://plus.google.com/113026104107031516488/about" target="_blank">Kevin Bourrillion</a> and <a href="https://plus.google.com/+KurtAlfredKluever/about" target="_blank">Kurt Alfred Kluever</a>, etc.<br /></p>

<p>Guava follows almost all the excellent patterns and practices mentioned in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Edition-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683" target="_blank">Effective Java book</a> written by <a href="https://plus.google.com/113200173329286634669/about" target="_blank">Joshua Bloch</a>, who has designed the impeccable Java Collections API while he was at Sun. Later he joined Google. Under his mentor-ship, Google Guava got wings and became a very well designed and effective API, useful for many situations and scenarios with an ever-growing feature list. I ensure I add Guava dependency as the first thing to my Gradle or Maven build script. Guava makes <code>Java</code> code a lot more readable, clean, simple and elegant. It utilises the Java generics very well.<!--more--><br />
<br />
Consider the following example which I tweeted few months back.<br />
<a href="https://twitter.com/P7h/status/195895898146996224" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/Guava_Sample.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Which of the above versions looks fine? Obviously the second option, aint it?
There are many such examples where Guava wins by a margin compared to normal Java code and or other libraries like commons, etc.</p>

<p>Guava also helps for [in a way] functional programming too. There are few options which are really helpful there as well. Having said that, Guava creators <a href="https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/FunctionalExplained" target="_blank">implore the developers</a> not to litter code with too much functional programming which might lead to unreadable code.</p>

<p>I will start with writing few posts on Google Guava with the tag, “LearningGuava”. I have been using Guava extensively in almost every project of mine since few years. This will not only help some one else looking for info or starting on Google Guava, but as well as for me also so that I will remember in future if I need any quick snippet on something specific with Guava usage. That being the motivation, I hope it will be of good experience for you and me as well.</p>

<p>This post will list all the posts written for Google Guava. This post kinda serves as an Index and quick reference of my Google Guava posts.</p>
