    <updated>2015-01-12T00:12:46+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://p7h.org/blog/2015/01/12/first-blogpost-with-octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my first blogpost using Octopress and GitHub.</p>

<p>Previously, I had my blogs hosted on <a href="http://P7h.blogspot.com">Blogger</a>.
Though Blogger engine is good, I could never spend time to create a template on my own to make my blogpage look good and on top of that the default templates and layouting always made go crazy since its too tedious to spend time on fine-tuning and make the page look zazzy.</p>

<!--more-->


<p>Being a minimalist, I would like to go with minimum cruft and more emphasis on the code and content rather than the styling of the blogpage with an attractive UI.</p>

<p>So here I am, trying to use Octopress and trying to generate static pages using GitHub. I went with default Octopress template. Setting it up on Windows with Ruby was a bit painful initially and I went helter-skelter looking for help mostly with Google and SO. But after 2 trials, I was able to get my default website up and running. I hope this will be a nice experience with just markdown and code-highlighting to the rescue.</p>

<p>Over a period of time or whenever I get time, I will be moving all my blogposts from Blogger to GitHub hosted static pages. Though its a considerable effort, I would like to give it a shot and move away from Blogger and maintain this as my primary blogpage.</p>

<p>For now, just &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;. :-)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<div style="font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"><span style="font-family: Roboto;">I am a huge fan of <a href="http://storm.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache Storm</a> for its simplicity and ease of use and more so the uncomplicated way of solving Big Data problems. I have given a <a href="https://fifthelephant.in/2013/workshops" target="_blank">session</a> on this at Fifth Elephant, 2013 too. <br />For all Big Data projects I always try to utilize Storm whenever we deal with any real-time streaming use cases as such. Storm is good and a well-designed tool for solving real-time streaming issues and hence the reason its dubbed as <i>Hadoop of the real-time</i>. I have open sourced many projects on my <a href="https://github.com/P7h" target="_blank">GitHub account</a> which use Storm as the processing engine.<br /><br /><a href="https://www.udacity.com/" target="_blank">Udacity</a> is one of the 3 wonderful MOOCs we have right now, which also include Coursera and edX. Udacity already has a course on Apache Hadoop titled, &#8221;<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ud617" target="_blank">Intro to Hadoop and MapReduce</a>&#8221;. Udacity created this course collaborating with <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/" target="_blank">Cloudera</a>. I have done this course last year though I have not opted for the [paid] verified certificate for this course, since I am already a Cloudera Certified Developer for Apache Hadoop [CCDH]. You can find the solutions to all the assignments of this course also on my GitHub account.<br /><br />Now Udacity has started a <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ud381" target="_blank">new course</a> on Storm, as part of their <a href="https://www.udacity.com/courses#!/data-science" target="_blank">Data Science catalog</a>. This particular course is in partnership with Twitter. Just in case if you are not aware, Storm was open sourced at Twitter and they are one of the power users of Storm for their use cases. Hence it makes great sense to have them teach and talk about Storm. And also the syllabus looks really interesting.<br /></span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq" style="background-color: white; box-sizing: border-box; color: #303030; font-family: Roboto, 'Whitney SSm A', 'Whitney SSm B', 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 23.7999992370605px; margin-bottom: 15px;"><span style="font-family: Roboto;"><b>Lesson 1</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Roboto;">Join instructor Karthik Ramasamy and the first Udacity-Twitter Storm Hackathon to cover the motivation and practice of real-time, distributed, fault-tolerant data processing. Dive into basic Storm Topologies by linking to a real-time d3 Word Cloud Visualization using Redis, Flask, and d3.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Roboto;"><b>Lesson 2</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Roboto;">Explore Storm basics by programming Bolts, linking Spouts, and finally connecting to the live Twitter API to process real-time tweets. Explore open source components by connecting a Rolling Count Bolt to your topology to visualize Rolling Top Tweeted Words.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Roboto;"><b>Lesson 3</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Roboto;">Go beyond Storm basics by exploring multi-language capabilities to download and parse real-time Tweeted URLs in Python using Beautiful Soup. Integrate complex open source bolts to calculate Top-N words to visualize real-time Top-N Hashtags. Finally, use stream grouping concepts to easily create streaming join to connect and dynamically process multiple streams.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Roboto;"><b>Lesson 4</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: Roboto;">Work on your final project and we cover additional questions and topics brought up by Hackathon participants. Explore Vagrant, VirtualBox, Redis, Flask, and d3 further if you are interested!</span></blockquote><span style="font-family: Roboto;"><br />I am really excited about this course and I am already half-way thru with the first lesson and its pretty pleasant experience till now.</span><br /><div><span style="font-family: Roboto;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Roboto;">Unfortunately, this course does not cover few of the important topics of Storm like Ack, Cluster and Trident. That&#8217;s a dampener for an otherwise some pretty great content. Needless to say, if they would have included these wonderful topics, this course would have been a really wonderful course and a go-to one for any Storm related course on the internet. But alas!</span></div><div><span style="font-family: Roboto;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Roboto;">Anyways, I am planning to go ahead and complete the course by the end of this month and if the course guidelines permit, I will put the solutions of the assignments up on my GitHub account.</span><span style="font-family: Roboto;"></span><br /><div><span style="font-family: Roboto;"><br />If you are interested in or your work includes solving real-time Big Data use cases, you might want to checkout this course: <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ud381">https://www.udacity.com/course/ud381</a>. </span><br /><div><span style="font-family: Roboto;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Roboto;">Happy learning!&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Roboto;">And all the very best too.</span></div></div></div></div></div>

    <updated>2014-10-18T00:00:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://p7h.org/blog/2014/10/18/jdk-download-command-prompt</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<div style="font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"><span style="font-family: Roboto;">Its been really sometime since I blogged anything. Got into too much work both on personal and professional fronts. I will try to be regular henceforth though, hopefully [fingers crossed!!].<br /><br />Most of my work happens on EC2 and on Linux as our Hadoop env is on EC2. I absolutely adore Linux and shell. And first and foremost thing I have to do - being a Java developer - is download Oracle JDK onto the Linux machines on EC2. And downloading Oracle JDK from Oracle website is difficult due to Oracle&#8217;s mandatory license check, which you need to accept before downloading the JDK. With my Linux env being server-only-machines [i.e. without a desktop or GUI], there is no way I could download the JDK directly from Oracle website. So, I came up with this small shell script [extending an <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/10959815" target="_blank">answer</a> from Stackoverflow] to download JDK from Oracle website from command prompt.<br /><br />Depending on the OS and platform of the JDK version you intend to download, just modify the array on line#20 in the following script and you can trigger the download on the shell directly.<br />Hope this script will be helpful for all those who live on and love command prompt. <script src="https://gist.github.com/P7h/9741922.js?file=jdk_download.sh"></script></span></div></div>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class='post'>
<div style="font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"><span style="font-family: Roboto;">Many of our day-to-day applications would need calibrating time taken between 2 points. In Java world we either depend on </span><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#currentTimeMillis()" target="_blank"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">System.currentTimeMillis()</span></a><span style="font-family: Roboto;"> or </span><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/System.html#nanoTime()" target="_blank"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">System.nanoTime()</span></a><span style="font-family: Roboto;">. But the pain here is, we have to do the required computations of getting to a proper granularity to understand the time taken.Would n&#8217;t it be great it to have such an utility class which will give the required information in the granularity we need with minimum amount of boilerplate code?  </span><br /><div style="font-family: Roboto;"><br /></div><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><a href="http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/base/Stopwatch.html" target="_blank">Stopwatch</a> </span><span style="font-family: Roboto;">is one such small and wonderful utility class in </span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Guava</span><span style="font-family: Roboto;"> which helps in calibrating elapsed time / duration between any 2 points in the logic. The advantage of using </span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Guava</span><span style="font-family: Roboto;">&#8217;s </span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Stopwatch</span><span style="font-family: Roboto;"> is you can get the elapsed time in any measure i.e. right from nanoseconds to days. This is possible because you can pass an enum argument type of </span><a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/TimeUnit.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">TimeUnit</span></a><span style="font-family: Roboto;"> class to get the elapsed time in the desired granularity.  </span><br /><div style="font-family: Roboto;"><br /></div><span style="font-family: Roboto;">Code snippet for the usage of the </span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Stopwatch</span><span style="font-family: Roboto;"> class: </span><script src="https://gist.github.com/P7h/8691100.js"></script>  <br /><div style="font-family: Roboto;"><br /></div><span style="font-family: Roboto;">Few caveats for using </span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Stopwatch</span><span style="font-family: Roboto;"> are you should not start an already started </span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Stopwatch</span><span style="font-family: Roboto;">. One has to check if the </span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Stopwatch</span><span style="font-family: Roboto;"> is already running by invoking </span><a href="http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/base/Stopwatch.html#isRunning()" target="_blank"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">isRunning()</span></a><span style="font-family: Roboto;"> method. </span><br /><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Stopwatch</span><span style="font-family: Roboto;"> documentation says the following on the same: </span><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Stopwatch</span><span style="font-family: Roboto;"> methods are not idempotent; it is an error to start or stop a stopwatch that is already in the desired state. </span></blockquote><div style="font-family: Roboto;"><br /></div><span style="font-family: Roboto;">Also, once I got burned down by </span><a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/javadocs/api-3.2.1/org/apache/commons/lang3/time/StopWatch.html" target="_blank"><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">StopWatch</span></a><span style="font-family: Roboto;"> class of Apache Commons Lang. As I was working in an IDE on a Maven project, I could not relate to the difference between </span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Stopwatch</span><span style="font-family: Roboto;"> of </span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Guava</span><span style="font-family: Roboto;"> and </span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">StopWatch</span><span style="font-family: Roboto;"> of Commons Lang as the class got auto imported into the code and then spent some 20 minutes trying to check my classpath, IDE setup, etc. Yes how stupid of me, right? So, please be careful in choosing the correct class. </span></div></div>

<span style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px;">​I have been a huge fan of </span><a href="https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/" style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px;" target="_blank">Google Guava</a><span style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px;"> from the time I came across it 3 years back.</span><br /><div style="font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"><span style="font-family: Roboto;">For starters, </span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Guava</span><span style="font-family: Roboto;"> is a project which contains many Google&#8217;s core libraries like collections, caching, math, primitives, concurrency, networking, common annotations, string processing, I/O, refelction and many others.</span><br /><div style="font-family: Roboto;">It is very well designed API. Guava is designed, implemented and maintained by Google Engineers like <a href="https://plus.google.com/113026104107031516488/about" target="_blank">Kevin Bourrillion</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://plus.google.com/+KurtAlfredKluever/about" target="_blank">Kurt Alfred Kluever</a>, etc.</div><div style="font-family: Roboto;"><br /></div><span style="font-family: Roboto;">Guava follows almost all the excellent patterns and practices mentioned in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Edition-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0321356683" target="_blank">Effective Java book</a>&nbsp;written by <a href="https://plus.google.com/113200173329286634669/about" target="_blank">Joshua Bloch</a>, who has designed the impeccable Java Collections API while he was at Sun. Later he joined Google. Under his mentor-ship, Google Guava got wings and became a very well designed and effective API, useful for many situations and scenarios with an ever-growing feature list. I ensure I add Guava dependency as the first thing to my Gradle or Maven build script. Guava makes </span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Java</span><span style="font-family: Roboto;"> code a lot more readable, clean, simple and elegant. It utilises the Java generics very well.</span><br /><div style="font-family: Roboto;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Roboto;">Consider the following example which I tweeted few months back.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: Roboto; text-align: center;"><a href="https://twitter.com/P7h/status/195895898146996224" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"><img alt="Google Guava sample code" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aCDnApHuz44/UpZBg-vLbII/AAAAAAAACag/wxy58EaJXMw/s1600/Guava_Sample.png" height="185" title="Google Guava sample code" width="640" /></a></div><div style="font-family: Roboto;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Roboto;">Which of the above versions looks fine? Obviously the second option, aint it?</div><div style="font-family: Roboto;">There are many such examples where Guava wins by a margin compared to normal Java code and or other libraries like commons, etc.</div><div style="font-family: Roboto;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Roboto;">Guava also helps for [in&nbsp;a way] functional programming too. There are few options which are really helpful there as well. Having said that, Guava creators <a href="https://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/FunctionalExplained" target="_blank">implore the developers</a> not to litter code with too much functional programming which might lead to unreadable code.</div><div style="font-family: Roboto;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Roboto;">I will start with writing few posts on Google Guava with the tag, &#8220;LearningGuava&#8221;. I have been using Guava extensively in almost every project of mine since few years. This will not only help some one else looking for info or starting on Google Guava, but as well as for me also so that I will remember in future if I need any quick snippet on something specific with Guava usage. That being the motivation, I hope it will be of good experience for you and me as well.</div><div style="font-family: Roboto;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Roboto;">This post will have list of all the posts written for Google Guava.

The biggest USP of any of the HasGeek organized conferences [other than being community powered conferences] is, they live stream most of the sessions and they also upload all the recorded videos to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/hasgeek/videos" target="_blank">Youtube</a> and / or&nbsp;<a href="http://hasgeek.tv/fifthelephant/" target="_blank">HasGeek TV</a>.</div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">I gave a session on <i>Introduction to Pig</i>&nbsp;at The Fifth Elephant last year. I have written about it previously&nbsp;<a href="http://p7h.blogspot.in/2013/01/intro-to-pig.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</div><div style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">The Fifth Elephant is back this year. Its even better with a dedicated day for Workshops at the same venue and the regular 2-day Conference on Big Data, Storage and Analytics and also with the product demos and hacker corners. There are some wonderful sessions proposed including one on Neo4J, Julia, etc and few sessions have already been selected by the Program Committee.</div></div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">I have been working on Big Data especially on Hadoop Ecosystem since more than 2 years now. I am fascinated by Big Data and various tools / frameworks which help analyze such large amounts of data. During this time, I came across <a href="http://storm-project.net/" target="_blank">Storm</a>, which not just analyzes the Big Data, but analyzes in real-time. Yes, real-time very unlike Hadoop, which is basically batch-processing. I worked on couple of use cases and processed the streaming live data in really real-time using Storm. I can quote streaming tweets as my main source of real-time data , which I processed for multiple use cases using Storm.</div></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div><div style="text-align: justify;">This year I have proposed a session on Storm titled <a href="http://funnel.hasgeek.com/fifthel2013/652-big-data-real-time-processing-and-storm" target="_blank">&#8220;Big Data, Real-time Processing and Storm&#8221;</a>&nbsp;and it has been accepted as the first workshop this time around. I will be speaking on 11th July, 2013. It will be a live-coding session, which will help the participants understand and appreciate Storm as one of the better alternatives of Hadoop. Below is the outline of this workshop.</div></div><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="486" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" mozallowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" src="http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/17823469?rel=0" style="border-width: 1px 1px 0; border: 1px solid #CCC; margin-bottom: 5px;" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="650px"> </iframe> <br /><div style="margin-bottom: 5px;"><div style="text-align: center;"><strong> <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/prashanthvvbabu/big-data-realtime-processing-and-storm" target="_blank" title="Big Data, Real-time Processing and Storm">Big Data, Real-time Processing and Storm</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/prashanthvvbabu" target="_blank">Prashanth Babu</a></strong> </div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;">I have also uploaded the slides of the outline of this workshop to <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/p7h/big-data-real-time-processing-and-storm" target="_blank">SpeakerDeck</a>.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Check the above slides and do let me know if you have any feedback and / or comments on this outline for the workshop.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Wish me good luck on&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/P7h" target="_blank">@P7h</a>.

<span style="font-size: 15px;">Understanding Open Source licenses turns out to be rather too difficult. At least I always have had issues in understanding which Open Source license is too restrictive and which is a bit liberal.</span><br /><br /><div style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;">After looking around for some time, I found the following 3 alternatives for easily understanding the terms of few of the Open Source licenses.</div><br /><h3 style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;">Alternative#1</h3><div style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"><a class="g-profile" href="http://plus.google.com/101174951617223562800" target="_blank">+Brian Fitzpatrick</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="g-profile" href="http://plus.google.com/106739423424023436001" target="_blank">+Dan Bentley</a>&nbsp;have made a brilliant flow chart for Open Source licenses. It is pretty simple and easy to understand.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; white-space: normal;"><a href="http://cl.ly/5nAo" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vmJs6gfqySw/UZmSLZMaRfI/AAAAAAAACXM/DqOATVfaZRw/s640/OSS+License.png" width="497" /></a></div><br /><h3 style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;">Alternative#2</h3><div style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"><a class="g-profile" href="http://plus.google.com/113672091552048390436" target="_blank">+Marakana</a>&nbsp;have&nbsp;another interesting flowchart for understanding Open Source licenses.</div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; white-space: normal;"><a href="http://marakana.com/s/post/1030/understanding_open_source_licenses" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"><img border="0" height="438" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-o2kmCBv-ig0/UZmTFEQPb9I/AAAAAAAACXY/Jp2M7PorCPE/s640/OSS-licenses.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><h3 style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;">Alternative#3</h3><div style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;">And finally another option to understand Open Source licenses is <a href="http://www.tldrlegal.com/" target="_blank"><b>tl;drLegal</b></a> Website, which summarizes and explains Open Source licenses in simple terms and in plain English. Its a pretty decent website which is fast and also very intuitive and easy to use. Just key in the name of the License you want to read about. The website will do the rest with a quick summary and also the full text of this particular license.</div><br /><div style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;">I always look up to one of these alternatives when I am in doubt about licensing terms of a particular Open Source License. And when I need to check the complete text of a license, I usually use&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tldrlegal.com/" style="font-size: medium;" target="_blank"><b>tl;drLegal</b></a> Website.<br /><br />Hope this is of some help to you too.</div></div>

<div style="font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Roboto;">In continuation to my </span><a href="http://p7h.blogspot.com/2012/12/intellij-idea-tuning-parameters.html" style="font-family: Roboto;" target="_blank">other post</a><span style="font-family: Roboto;"> on </span><a href="http://www.eclipse.org/" style="font-family: Roboto;" target="_blank">Eclipse</a><span style="font-family: Roboto;">, in this post I am detailing the startup options [which are also called JVM Settings] on Eclipse IDE. Eclipse startup is controlled by the options in </span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">eclipse.ini</span><span style="font-family: Roboto;"> file present under Eclipse installation folder [i.e. $ECLIPSE_HOME]. By default, Eclipse comes with a set of values in this file. But those values are not optimized and might cause issues and / or hangs in large projects which might have huge codebase. These can be tuned further for better performance.</span></div><br /><div style="font-family: Roboto;"><div style="text-align: justify;">My startup options in my current version of Eclipse Juno i.e. v4.2.1 are below:</div><span style="font-family: Roboto;"><script src="https://gist.github.com/4392224.js"></script><br />Please use these options as a reference and update </span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">eclipse.ini</span><span style="font-family: Roboto;"> file [please do take a backup of this file prior to updating it]. Also, one more important point to note is, use the latest <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html" target="_blank">Sun / Oracle JDK</a> for starting Eclipse. This also has a profound effect on the Eclipse startup time as well as the IDE functionality with a decent sized codebase.</span></div><br /><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Roboto;">Finally, in case you were looking for tuning the startup options of IntelliJ IDEA, please refer my <a href="http://p7h.blogspot.com/2012/12/intellij-idea-tuning-parameters.html" target="_blank">earlier post</a> which details the parameters for IDEA.</span></div></div></div>

<div style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"><div style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://eclipse.org/" target="_blank">Eclipse</a> was my main IDE for all my JavaEE and Web development all the time in my career. For all plain Java development and Android app development, I used to revert to <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank">IntelliJ IDEA</a> Community Edition, which allows only plain Java development and not Enterprise Java development i.e. JavaEE or Web Development [Spring, Hibernate, Grails, etc]. For more info on what is allowed and what is not allowed in Community Edition, please refer&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html" target="_blank">this matrix</a>&nbsp;on JetBrains website. Post the <a href="http://p7h.blogspot.com/2012/12/jetbrains-mayan-doomsday-special-offers.html" target="_blank">Mayan Doomsday Offer</a> by JetBrains, thanks to the 75% steep discount on 20th December, I now have IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition as well.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br />Eclipse is open source and is free to use. It is a thriving community for individuals and organizations which collaborate on commercially-friendly open source software. So, over a period of time Eclipse grew on all developers and almost everyone uses it as their main driver for development. And what&#8217;s more with Scala, Groovy and Android teams giving support for Eclipse as the first IDE has given it a good momentum in the past few years.&nbsp;The plugin ecosystem is huge in Eclipse and in fact, these plugins have helped Eclipse grow as a platform what it is today.&nbsp;Such is the popularity of plugins in Eclipse ecosystem that they have also launched <a href="http://marketplace.eclipse.org/" target="_blank">Marketplace</a> for Eclipse plugins. If something is missing in Eclipse, don&#8217;t worry, just check the Marketplace for the plugin or else you can develop a plugin in no time actually. That has been the mindset of a lot of Java developers in Eclipse ecosystem. There are thousands of plugins available for Eclipse right from customizing the IDE to Maven integration to Python IDE to Spring IDE, for Checkstyle, PMD, FindBugs, etc.&nbsp;</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">With all my prior experience in using Eclipse, I have some goto plugins which I install the moment I get a brand new Eclipse version.&nbsp;Here is the list of all Eclipse plugins which I have used till now with a short description and the Eclipse Update Sites of the plugin.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><script src="https://gist.github.com/4389668.js"></script>Hope this was of some help to you.</div><br />Also, if you are interested in IntelliJ IDEA plugins, please check my <a href="http://p7h.blogspot.com/2012/12/intellij-ide-plugins.html" target="_blank">earlier post</a>&nbsp;which lists down all the IDEA plugins which I use.</div></div>

Also, as I make it a point to use Google Guava in all my projects, I have defined the following template in my </span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">toString()</span><span style="font-family: Roboto;"> method generator settings in IntelliJ IDEA.</span></div></div><script src="https://gist.github.com/4388630.js"></script><br /><div style="font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px;">Follow the steps mentioned below for adding this template to your IntelliJ IDEA [picked up from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/9445402" target="_blank">SO</a>]:<br /></span></div><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px;">Go inside a Java Class in an editor in IntelliJ IDEA</span></li><span style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px;"><li style="text-align: justify;">Hit Alt + Insert to popup the &#8220;Generate&#8221; menu</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Choose toString()</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Click the &#8220;Settings&#8221; button</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Go to the &#8220;Templates&#8221; tab</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Create a new template named &#8220;Guava toString gen&#8221; (or any name you prefer)</li><li style="text-align: justify;">Add the above code to the template</li></span></ul></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px;">Yes, its that simple!!&nbsp; After configuring the above template, whenever you want to generate a </span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: 15px;">toString()</span><span style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px;"> method for a Class, IntelliJ IDEA generates </span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace; font-size: 15px;">toString()</span><span style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px;"> using Guava template you have added just now.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px;">Now, go ahead and give this a try and also check the other method </span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><a href="http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/base/Objects.ToStringHelper.html#omitNullValues()" target="_blank">omitNullValues()</a></span><span style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px;"> which might be useful in some scenarios.</span></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px;"><br /></span></div><span style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px;"><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-family: Roboto;">Also, as a bonus tip, Guava&#8217;s <a href="http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/base/Objects.html" target="_blank">Objects</a> class also has 2 awesome helper methods which aide in writing readable&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><a href="http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/base/Objects.html#equal(java.lang.Object, java.lang.Object)" target="_blank">equals()</a></span><span style="font-family: Roboto;"> and </span><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;"><a href="http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/com/google/common/base/Objects.html#hashCode(java.lang.Object...)" target="_blank">hashcode()</a></span><span style="font-family: Roboto;"> methods.

<div style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"><div style="text-align: justify;">In an earlier <a href="http://p7h.blogspot.com/2012/12/packages-in-sublime-text.html" target="_blank">post</a>, I have listed all the plugins I use in my Sublime Text Editor.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Whenever you edit your Settings in Sublime Text, ensure you update <i>Settings - User</i> under <i>Preferences</i> and not any other file since once you install an update to Sublime Text, the installer does not fiddle with <i>Settings - User</i> and hence you can retain all your settings even in the updated version. Donot update <i>Settings - Default</i>, since it will be erased with the latest version&#8217;s Settings file.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">I played around my Settings and currently I have configured my Sublime Text as per my requirement. Here are my User Settings:</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><script src="https://gist.github.com/4388796.js"></script>Use these settings as the base and try to create your own flair for your work as per your taste. I am sure it will help you in increased efficiency and productivity in your work. All the best!</div></div></div>

<div style="font-family: Roboto; font-size: 15px; white-space: normal;"><div style="text-align: justify;">If I am not working on Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA, I will be grokking on <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text 2</a>. Its a wonderful text editor and in fact it&#8217;s more than a text editor. Unlimited trial period, multiple cursors, easy customization, etc are its main USPs.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">There are a number of blogposts which explain why / how Sublime Text is good. Two of them are from NetTuts. Follow them and see how simple and easy it is to configure and personalize Sublime as per your requirements:</div><ul><li style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/tools-and-tips/sublime-text-2-tips-and-tricks/" target="_blank">Sublime Text 2 Tips and Tricks</a></li><li style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://tutsplus.com/course/improve-workflow-in-sublime-text-2/" target="_blank">Perfect Workflow in Sublime Text 2</a></li></ul><div style="text-align: justify;">If you have followed the above articles, you would know that the first thing you do after installing Sublime Text is, install <a href="http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control" target="_blank">Package Control</a>&nbsp;and its all simple from there to install other packages.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br /></div><div style="text-align: justify;">Following is the list of packages I have right now which are very useful for my work.</div><div style="text-align: justify;">First install Package Control and then search for the required packages in Package Control for installation, that&#8217;s all you have to do.</div><div style="text-align: justify;"><script src="https://gist.github.com/4388830.js"></script>In a future post, I will add <a href="http://p7h.blogspot.com/2012/12/my-user-settings-of-sublime-text.html" target="_blank">my User Settings of Sublime Text</a>.</div></div></div>
